# Notes

## Basics

### Lambda Calculus

* referential transparency (pure functions):
    * will always return the same result given the same inputs
    * no side-effects
* lambda terms:
    * expression
    * variable
    * abstraction
        * basically a function
        * consists of a _head_ and a _body_
        * _head_ is a Î» followed by a variable name
        * _body_ is another expression
    * lambda abstraction is an anonymous function
    * combinator:
        * lambda term with no free variables
