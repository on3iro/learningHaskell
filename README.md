I decided to learn haskell with the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/). We will see where it leads me, but right now I am pretty excited about the endeavour =)

If you are looking for actual answers to the books excercises in a structured manner have a look at [this repo](https://github.com/lukleh/haskell-book-exercises)
