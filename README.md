# learningHaskell

I decided to learn haskell with the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/). We will see where it leads me, but right now I am pretty excited about the endeavour =)
These are my personal notes and test files of given examples and exercises.

If you are looking for actual answers to the books exercises in a structured manner have a look at [this repo](https://github.com/lukleh/haskell-book-exercises)

* [Strings](Strings.md)
* [Curry](Curry.md)
